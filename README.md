# tundra

The Tundra programming language - a high-level programming language targeting LLVM. 
Written in C++17. Currently very, very early work-in-progress.

## Introduction
I wanted to learn more about compilers and programming language theory, which is why I 
set out to implement my own small programming language. For now, I opted for compiling to
LLVM IR, since this seemed the easiest way to get started.

## Features
None yet.

## Building
